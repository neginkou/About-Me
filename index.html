  <main>
    <p>
      My name is Negin, and I'm a 32-year-old originally from Iran. My life has been a series of courageous leaps
      and transformative chapters. At the tender age of 18, I ventured alone to Malaysia to pursue higher
      education, a journey that required immense courage and independence. At 21, my family and I made a
      life-altering decision to immigrate to the United States, where I found myself juggling full-time work in
      the challenging field of banking while diligently pursuing my education part-time.</p>

    <p>
      five years of dedicated service in the banking industry, I embarked on a new adventure by enlisting in
      the U.S. Army, where I devoted three years to active duty, serving my country. This commitment wasn't
      without its trials, as I sustained an injury during my service. However, my unwavering determination carried
      me through, and I recently received an honorable discharge from the military.</p>

    <p>
      I'm setting my sights on a long-held dream. With a passion for technology, I'm beginning a new journey
      as a software developer. This exciting career transition reflects not only my aspirations but also my
      determination to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible. My life's journey has been an
      ever-evolving story of resilience, adaptability, and relentless pursuit of my dreams, and I'm excited to see
      where this new chapter takes me.</p>
